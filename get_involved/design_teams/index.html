There are two main parts to the vision of Project Holodeck: one is to create an increasingly large database or server housing significant historical and present day locations and people, built from pictures and accounts from others. Two is to integrate existing technologies and develop our own to create as immersive and realistic an experience of virtual reality as possible. This project&#039;s application is transferrable and extendable to practically any industry. It can be used to give people an immersive experience of what history was like, teach people hands-on skills, practice dangerous or impractical tasks, or simply have fun. Project Holodeck will let people boldly go where no one has gone before!</p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="mailto:utoph@skule.ca">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="http://utoph.skule.ca">Website</a>

                                        <p>In pursuit of a true multidisciplinary, hands-on experience, undergraduate chemical engineering students founded the University of Toronto Chemical Vehicles Design Team. The team&#039;s primary focus is to research, design, build, integrate, and optimize different systems to create a small, autonomous, chemically powered car every year. However, we also work on various side-projects that focuses on building up technical and leadership knowledge of all team members and help to diversify the team as a whole. If you are interested in working in a safe laboratory environment, learning about innovative electrochemistry and reaction kinetics, building cars, or even working behind the scenes to manage resources, logistics, and plan events, then UTCV is the team to join.

                                        <p>We are a design team with one simple goal: to design, build and safely race a concrete toboggan each and every year for the Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race. The annual Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race (GNCTR) started in 1974 at the University of Alberta. The main objective was simple; create a toboggan with a running surface made entirely out of concrete which is capable of carrying five riders safely down a hill. Since then, the rules have evolved slightly (including the addition of brakes and steering systems), but the heart of the competition has remained unchanged. We design and build everything ourselves, and compete annually in this national event. As a part of this competition, teams are challenged to design their toboggan to optimize for several different criteria including performance, theoretical design, sustainability and concrete mix design. The unique design challenge forces students to think outside the box and gives them the opportunity to apply engineering principles and techniques learned in class on an actual design product. In addition to practicing these engineering theories, students gain hands-on experience and networking opportunities with a variety of industry professionals.</p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="mailto:captain@toboggan.skule.ca">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="http://www.toboggan.skule.ca/">Website</a>

There are 3 major design processes: Hull and Structural, Concrete, and Construction. Beginning with Hull and Structural, we design the canoe’s shape using in-depth fluid mechanics applications and running software simulations. At Concrete, the best mix is determined after batching and testing. Finally, Construction plays a major role in Casting Day, where everyone comes to cast the entire canoe with concrete. After curing, sanding, and sealing, we then race against universities from all across Canada in competition. We are looking for individuals excited to learn and not afraid to get their hands dirty. Any level of technical experience is welcome and all innovative ideas are appreciated. At Concrete Canoe, we also value personal development, and we try to help everyone build their toolkits and portfolios. Alumni members are a big part of our community, so as a member you get to connect and learn from various talented individuals. Additionally, general members will have many opportunities to gain hands-on experience whether it is concrete mixing, software learning, or construction projects. </p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="ellentan.1102@gmail.com">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="https://canoe.skule.ca/">Website</a>

                                        <p> We are a student-run innovation lab that seeks to investigate creative and sustainable building ideas and move them from concept to completion. We aim to offer a practical space to learn about innovative concepts in the world of sustainable built form. We invite students in engineering and architecture to work with us on long-term, student-run, design and build projects. Throughout the year, we will provide students opportunities to participate in hands-on workshops, seminars with experts, design and prototyping sessions, and a whole lot of brainstorming as a team. In the springtime, we host a speakers night event that acts as an opportunity to share our work, network with professionals, and learn about advancements in the sustainable building sector. Building projects occur most summers and aim to integrate our exploratory efforts into practical and sustainable living solutions. Overall, it is our goal to promote collaboration with academic and industry leaders in sustainable building design and provide students with hands-on building and collaborative design experience. Finally, we will use our building projects and creative media to raise awareness of these sustainable built forms. </p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="lombardiselena@gmail.com">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="https://www.futurelivinglab.ca">Website</a>

It is the only team that is focusing on developing human-centric solutions to facilitate space exploration through habitation, that too primarily in the area of Mars. Many misconceptions exist about the complexity of space design and who can get involved in it. While we admit that it is not easy, it is definitely a field that undergraduate students can be involved and excel in, especially with all the resources available to us at the University. In addition, the team aims to build sustainable Martian systems that would make it more feasible for Humans to settle on the Red Planet or simply harvest its resources for use on Earth. After all, WE could be the ones traveling there one day! </p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="iset@skule.ca">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="iset.skule.ca">Website</a>

                                        <p> We are a design team with one simple goal: to design, build and safely race a concrete toboggan each and every year for the Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race. The annual Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race (GNCTR) started in 1974 at the University of Alberta. The main objective was simple; create a toboggan with a running surface made entirely out of concrete which is capable of carrying five riders safely down a hill. Since then, the rules have evolved slightly (including the addition of brakes and steering systems), but the heart of the competition has remained unchanged. We design and build everything ourselves, and compete annually in this national event. As a part of this competition, teams are challenged to design their toboggan to optimize for several different criteria including performance, theoretical design, sustainability and concrete mix design. The unique design challenge forces students to think outside the box and gives them the opportunity to apply engineering principles and techniques learned in class on an actual design product. In addition to practicing these engineering theories, students gain hands-on experience and networking opportunities with a variety of industry professionals. </p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="captain@toboggan.skule.ca">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="https://www.toboggan.skule.ca">Website</a>
