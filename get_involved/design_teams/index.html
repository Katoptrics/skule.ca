The main objective was simple; create a toboggan with a running surface made entirely out of concrete which is capable of carrying five riders safely down a hill. Since then, the rules have evolved slightly (including the addition of brakes and steering systems), but the heart of the competition has remained unchanged. We design and build everything ourselves, and compete annually in this national event. As a part of this competition, teams are challenged to design their toboggan to optimize for several different criteria including performance, theoretical design, sustainability and concrete mix design. The unique design challenge forces students to think outside the box and gives them the opportunity to apply engineering principles and techniques learned in class on an actual design product. In addition to practicing these engineering theories, students gain hands-on experience and networking opportunities with a variety of industry professionals.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class="button is-small is-primary" href="mailto:captain@toboggan.skule.ca">Email</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class="button is-small is-primary" href="http://www.toboggan.skule.ca/">Website</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</article>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class="box" id="club16">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<article class="media">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="media-content">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="content">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong class="has-text-primary">Blue Sky Solar Racing</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Blue Sky Solar Racing is a student run design team that specializes in the design, build and racing of solar powered cars.

The main objective was simple; create a toboggan with a running surface made entirely out of concrete which is capable of carrying five riders safely down a hill.

The purpose of the University of Toronto Design League (UTDL) is to provide engineering students of all disciplines and backgrounds an opportunity to learn and develop core mechanical design skills. There is an emphasis on real-world applications of additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping and CAD. All the events held by UTDL provide attendees across Ontario with a platform to learn technical skills as well as to design, fabricate and showcase their innovative solutions for real-life mechanical engineering design problems faced by our diverse industry partners. </p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="uoftdesignleague@gmail.com">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="https://www.uoftdesignleague.com/">Website</a> </div> </div> </article> </div> \r\n\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</section>    <!-- Main Content End -->\n\n    <!-- Footer -->\n    <footer class="footer">\n    <div class="container">\n        <div class="columns is-gapless">\n            <div class="column is-one-half">\n                <div class="box footer-box">\n                    <article class="media">\n                        <div class="media-left">\n                            <figure class="image is-64x64">\n                                <img src="assets/img/engsoc-crest-b.svg" alt="Image">\n                            </figure>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class="media-content">\n                            <div class="content">\n\n                                <!-- Footer Content - EngSoc Address -->\n                                <p><strong>University of Toronto Engineering Society</strong><br />\n                                B740 Sandford Fleming Building<br>\n                                10 King\'s College Road<br>\n                                Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3G4</p>\n\n                                <!-- Footer Content - Links -->\n                                <div>\n                                    <a href="https://twitter.com/Skule" title="Follow Skule\xe2\x84\xa2 on Twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter" style="font-size:20px;"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UofTEngSoc/" title="Like EngSoc on Facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook" style="font-size:20px;"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uoftengsoc/" title="Follow EngSoc on Instagram"><i class="fa fa-instagram" style="font-size:20px;"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYL97lTVwYeS_6PEyC6DnNg" title="Subscribe to SkuleTube"><i class="fa fa-youtube-play" style="font-size:20px;"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                                    <a href="./contact" title="Contact Us"><i class="fa fa-comment" style="font-size:20px;"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                                    <a href="mailto:engsoc@skule.ca" title="Send us an email"><i class="fa fa-envelope" style="font-size:20px;"></i></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                                </div>\n\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </article>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class="column is-one-half">\n                <p>This website was designed by your fellow engineers.</p>\n                <p>\xc2\xa9 2023 Skule&trade;.</p>\n                <p>Found an error, broken link, or bug in the site?
