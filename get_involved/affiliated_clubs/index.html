The fourth floor of 21 Sussex is also where our executive team of fourteen people meet. Our club cabin, located in the Blue Mountains, is our prized possession and a launch-point for many of our adventures. It is available for large group trips and for private use. The climbing crag, Metcalfe Rock, is mere steps away along with many hiking trails and an intricate caving system! Our cabin has no electricity or running water but a cozy wood-burning fireplace, a gas stove, and water cleaned from a nearby stream ensures an enjoyable experience. </p> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="talia.yawney@mail.utoronto.ca">Email</a> <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="www.utoc.ca">Website</a> </div> </div> </article> </div> \r\n <div class="box" id="Skule_Strategy_Game_Club"> <article class="media"> <div class="media-content"> <div class="content"> <p><strong class="has-text-primary">Skule Strategy Game Club</strong></p> <p> Skule Strategy Game Club is an Engineering based undergraduate club that dedicates to introducing strategic gaming to U of T students.

We hold several lettuce-themed events throughout the year, just for fun. We often get asked, "Why is there a Lettuce Club?", and to that we say "Why\r\n                    not?" Lettuce Club truly brings together people from all walks of life in the Skule(TM) community, because it is a zero-commitment club where it&#039;s easy to join in when events are being held. Some examples of events and\r\n                    activities that we host throughout the year are a lettuce eating contest, a lettuce pi\xc3\xb1ata event, an online lettuce bracket (where people from the Skule(TM) community vote in rounds for what their favourite type of\r\n                    lettuce is), and a monthly Newslettuce (a mailing list where lettuce memes, fun facts, recipes, etc. are sent to subscribers). Lettuce Club also prides itself on providing students with educational content such as\r\n                    sharing lettuce facts, and developing students&#039; leadership skills through volunteer event planning/running. Lettuce Club has an executive team consisting of the Head of Lettuce, Romain (marketing/graphics executive) and\r\n                    Iceberg (events planning executive). These members run the social media accounts and organize all lettuce events, but general members are always encouraged to suggest event ideas or send social media content if they so\r\n                    wish. Lettuce Club has an active Facebook group, where members (open to anyone) can share anything lettuce-related that they encounter. Examples include lettuce memes and pictures of lettuce that they see in their\r\n                    day-to-day life. Also in the realm of social media, Lettuce Club has recently started an Instagram account, where we post artwork sent in by members, recipe videos, and event announcements.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="mailto:lettuceclub@g.skule.ca">Email</a>\r\n<a class="button is-small is-primary" href="https://www.facebook.com/EngLettuceClub/">Website</a>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </article>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="box" id="club22">\r\n    <article class="media">\r\n        <div class="media-content">\r\n            <div class="content">\r\n                <p><strong class="has-text-primary">Humans Of Skule</strong></p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Humans Of Skule is a photoblog capturing stories of the University of Toronto Engineering Society - Skule\xe2\x84\xa2 community members and Faculty of Applied Science Members through photo-portraits, interviews and videography.

It begins with a catch 22 scenario of students everywhere while looking for internships. Employers require that students\r\n                    have prior experience so it feels impossible to get a foot in the door. VEEP addresses this gap by hosting and supporting industry level projects to get students the skill and experience they need. Secondly, we empower\r\n                    students to serve their communities with their technical abilities and by extension, learn more about the needs of the communities around them. Our students learn to showcase their experience in nuanced projects where\r\n                    many stakeholders are involved.Our project cycle takes course over a 6-8 month period, beginning in September of the fall semester until April of the Winter semester. Students work in teams of 4-6 with a project manager\r\n                    on a weekly basis on their project. While they communicate with their client, they have the full support of VEEP to complete the project. At the end of the year, students showcase their work at an end-of-year event for\r\n                    clients and students alike.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <a class="button is-small is-primary" href="mailto:kierancyphus@gmail.com">Email</a>\r\n<a class="button is-small is-primary" href="http://uoftveep.herokuapp.com/">Website</a>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </article>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class="title">Societal, Community, and Charity</h1><hr>\r\n<div class="box" id="club47">\r\n    <article class="media">\r\n        <div class="media-content">\r\n            <div class="content">\r\n                <p><strong class="has-text-primary">QueerSphere</strong></p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    QueerSphere is a student club dedicated to supporting queer engineering students on campus.
