<p> The Faculty's Office of Diversity, Inclusion & Professionalism is dedicated to making U of T Engineering a place where all students, faculty and staff feel they belong and can thrive â€” but we recognize much work remains to be done. If you witness or experience an incident of discrimination, harassment or harmful unprofessionalism in the Faculty, you can now make a confidential disclosure through the new incident disclosure form. Next steps and supports will be pursued according to the wishes of the person making the disclosure. More information and answers to FAQs on the disclosure form page.</p>
