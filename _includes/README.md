# skule.ca

This repository hosts [the Skule™ website](https://skule.ca). 

**Please read all of this page before editing the site.**

This site is powered by Jekyll, and uses the Bulma CSS theme. We have Markdown files that make up the content pages, and various layout pieces that generate everything around them. *Changes to layouts and includes should go through the Webmaster*.

## Directory Structure

```
_includes
    ├─> head.html       << scripts on all pages except home
    ├─> nav.html        << navbar on all pages except home
    └─> footer.html     << footer on all pages except home
    
_layouts
    └─> default.html    << layout for all pages except home

about, academics, bookings, ...
    ├─> ... .md         << pages - edit these !
    └─> assets          << add assets folders for page-specific assets

assets                  << sitewide assets only!
    └─> css
    │   └─> skule.css   << modifications to Bulma for skule.ca
    └─> img
        └─> ...         << various *sitewide* icons 

index.html              << homepage, fully self-contained
```

Every folder without an underscore, such as `about`, is a category. Each `.md` file in one of the folders is a page in that category.

The site automatically generates all the navigation elements based on this folder structure. Category names are generated by capitalising and cleaning folder names.

## How to Write Pages

Every page has a "front matter", which informs Jekyll of the page title, layout, and tab order.

```html
---
title: My Page
layout: default
order: 100
---

Page Content Begins
```
`title` and `layout` are mandatory. Always enter `default` as the layout. `order` allows manual ordering of the pages within
