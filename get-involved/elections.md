            <p>The elections process varies depending on the position. Elections are run by the CRO with the help of DROs (Deputy Returning officers) to ensure a fair and unbiased election. As such, EngSoc has put in place rules regarding nominations, campaigning, re-elections etc..

                            <p>The CRO is a neutral body who conducts EngSoc elections, ensuring that they are run fairly and democratically. Along with their Deputy Returning Officers (or DROs) as part of the Office of Returning Officers (or ORO), they spend much of the year refining the election policies and scheduling the elections for the year.</p> <a class="button is-small is-dark" href="mailto:cro@skule.ca">Email</a>
