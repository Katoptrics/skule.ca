The Engineering Society, or EngSoc, is the student government for undergraduate engineering students at the University of Toronto. It represents all full-time and part-time undergraduate engineers and is made up of elected student volunteers. EngSoc engages in academic advocacy, allocates funding to groups and initiatives in the community, and provides a wide variety of services and events to students. If there is anything you want to know about the Engineering Society that you can't find on this website, please email us or visit our office.

## Governance Structure
            
The Engineering Society is run by volunteers in a wide variety of positions. It would be impossible to list everyone who contributes to its operation, but this page includes information about many of those volunteers. To read more about each role, what that person does, and how you can contact them, expand one of the categories below. For a pretty infographic on our governance structure, [please click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDCFWZjzb2UAa5M2N31oe2J0RpOQ9c2J/).

## Officers
            
Officers handle EngSoc's day-to-day operations and external relations at a high level. Each of them also oversee a group of Project Directors related to their portfolios. They are elected directly by all full-time and part-time engineering students. [Visit the officers page](/about/officers/) to see a list of officers and their contact information.

## Board of Directors
            
The Board of Directors is the highest level of governance and oversees all of the operations of the Engineering Society, as well as the activities of the Officers. Board of Directors Representatives vote on major decisions concerning changes to EngSoc's services, methods of representation, and bylaws. The Board holds the Officers and Directors of the Society accountable for their actions, and ultimately ensures that the Engineering Society acts in the best interests of its Members. They are elected directly by all full-time and part-time engineering students in each of their constituencies. [Visit the governing members](/about/governing_members/) page to see a list of Boar of Directors members and their contact information.

## Project Directors
            
Project Directors each manage a particular service or initiative, from managing a cafe to teaching high school students about engineering. Many of them form committees or teams open to anyone at Skuleâ„¢ to achieve their goals for the year. They are elected by the outgoing EngSoc Council members near the end of their terms. [See the Project Directors page](/get_involved/directorships/) for more details.

## Associated Entities
            
Associated Entities are non-EngSoc organizations who are considered part of Council because of their contributions to the Skuleâ„¢ community. The method by which they are elected or appointed varies based on their position. For mor information, please [visit the Associated Entities page](/get_involved/associated/).

## Class Representatives
            
Class Representatives are members of each discipline and year who represent the concerns and values of their classmates to Discipline Clubs, EngSoc, and the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. They are elected directly by all full-time and part-time engineering students in each of their constituencies. [Visit the governing members](/about/governing_members/) page to see a list of class representatives and their contact information.
