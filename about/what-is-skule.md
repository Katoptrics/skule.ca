title: What is Skule?
layout: page
---

Skule™ is the name of the University of Toronto's engineering community at the St. George campus. It is made up of about 5000 undergraduate students, hundreds of graduate students, and a range of dedicated alumni. It is also home to hundreds of engineering clubs, athletics teams, design teams, and traditions (see below). The Skule™ name was first used almost a century ago when students discovered something that they had in common: engineers don't know how to spell. As something that the community created together, the Engineering Society trademarked the name in 1984.

## Traditions

Existing longer than a century, it is no wonder that Skule™ has so many rich traditions.

            <h2 class="subtitle"> Godiva Week is the Skule™'s other week-long festival celebrating Skule™ spirit, taking place in the first week of January after students come back from the holidays. Throughout the week students participate in auctions, the Charity Car Smash, Godiva's Quest, Ye Olde Chariot Race, and competitions to become the symbols of Skule™ spirit: Mr. Blue and Gold and Godiva's Crown. The week begins with Godiva's Resurrection and ends with Godiva's Wake since the celebration honours the legend of Lady Godiva, the patron saint of engineering. </h2>
