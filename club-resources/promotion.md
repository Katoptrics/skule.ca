EngSoc offers several outlets for affiliated and unaffiliated clubs to promote themselves. **The use of the Skule™ trademark (either in name or image) is a privilege reserved solely for affiliated clubs**. Unaffiliated clubs/groups may not use the Skule™ trademark in any manner, including, but not limited to, the club name, products, and promotional materials. No advertisements may claim to represent Skule™ as a whole nor indicate that the group is endorsed by the Engineering Society, unless told otherwise by the Vice-President Communications.

## Guide for Best Practices *(Coming Soon)*

A guidebook for best practices when marketing to students is currently under construction. In the meantime, if you'd like some advise or guidance, please reach out to the VP Communications at vpcomm@skule.ca.

## Mass Email

EngSoc circulates a monthly newsletter, "This Month at Skule™", sent to all Engineering students at the beginning of each month. The Newsletter contains events and announcements by affiliated clubs and various groups pertaining to the following month. If you would like to include an announcement in the next newsletter, please email the Vice-President Communications at [vpcomm@skule.ca](mailto:vpcomm@skule.ca) with a title, a blurb preferrably under 30 words but **no more than 50 words**, and an optional link.

## Posters

To place posters in engineering buildings and ensure that they are not removed by caretaking staff, posters can be stamped in the EngSoc office in the Sandford Fleming basement. Posters must be in English, should not be coloured mostly blue as that prevents the stamp from being visible, and must not be posted in a way that would cover doors, block glass, or chip paint. Posters are approved by the EngSoc Business Manager or an EngSoc Officer.

## The Pit Projector

The projector display above the Sandford Fleming basement is available for special events in the Atrium where a large screen is an asset, such as Havenger Scunt. Please submit any requests for this service to the Vice-President Communications at [vpcomm@skule.ca](mailto:vpcomm@skule.ca).

## ECF Login Screens

The ECF login screens rotate through a variety of promotions for campus events that support engineering development. Note that this service is managed by ECF staff, not the Engineering Society. Please submit any advertisements to the ECF [here](https://ssl.ecf.utoronto.ca/ecf/services/submitloginimg).

## Website Hosting and Domain Names

Affiliated clubs can request free website hosting or a skule.ca domain such as [lgmb.skule.ca](http://lgmb.skule.ca). Please contact the EngSoc Computer Systems Administrator at [sysadmin@skule.ca](mailto:sysadmin@skule.ca) and CC the Vice-President Communications at [vpcomm@skule.ca](mailto:vpcomm@skule.ca) in order to request this service. Users of either of these services must follow the [Subdomain Use Agreement](/club-resources/files/SkuleSubdomainUseAgreement.pdf).
