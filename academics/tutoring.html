                      <p>If you need a bit of extra help with a particular course or concept, take a look at the Skuleâ„¢ tutor database at <a href="http://tutors.skule.ca/">tutors.skule.ca</a>. There you can search by course code to see a variety of tutors with pricing information, tutor backgrounds and qualifications, and contact information so that you can find someone who is a good fit for you. If you are or know a graduate student interested in tutoring others, you can also apply to be a tutor.</p>
                          <p>Additionally, as a University of Toronto student you have access to tutorials and office hours for many of your courses. Check the syllabi and course descriptions of your courses to find more details about these services in the current term.</p>
