## Ancillary Fees

### Background Information
Each year, the University of Toronto Governing Council approves ancillary fees for certain courses, making them mandatory for the completion of a course or program. Non-approved fees can still be made optional to student (ie. an online resource that costs $10 to access), however if the fee is not approved, the student has other options (read steps below).

### Ancillary Fees
Ancillary fees are defined as fees mandatory to successfully complete a course or program. They include:
- Field trip costs
- Personal equipment that becomes the possession of a student (such as a lab coat or dissection kit)
- Administrative fees such as transcript fees or library fines

### What can you do when your course has a fee?
- Check the Ancillary Fees approved for the current academic year that you're in, found here [2017-2018 Approved Ancillary Fees](http://www.planningandbudget.utoronto.ca/Assets/Academic+Operations+Digital+Assets/Planning+$!26+Budget/lyanne/Category+5+Ancillary+Fees+2017-18.pdf). Look for your course-code and which specific fees were approved.
- If the fee was approved in the document, this fee is mandatory and must be paid for successful completion. You can always approach your class reps, or the professor directly, if you would like to raise concerns; however, the fees are legal.
- If you do not find your course or fee in the Approved Ancillary Fees for this academic year, it was not approved. If you would like to verify, or ask any questions, you may email [planning.budget@utoronto.ca](mailto:planning.budget@utoronto.ca).
- Since there is a course fee that is not mandatory, the professor must be able to provide a free alternative that will allow you to complete the course/degree. For example: if an online problem set costs $10 to access, but the fee is not mandatory, the professor may offer to accept paper submissions of a different set of problems.
- Talk to your class reps, or e-mail VP Academic ([vpacademic@skule.ca](mailto:vpacademic@skule.ca)) if you need additional support or have further questions.
