Whether you had a rough start to the term and need some help catching up, or are looking to refine your studies, there are many ways to get extra academic support. Here are some of them:

## Past Midterms, Exams and Syllabi
- Engineering past midterms, exams and syllabi on [courses.skule.ca](http://www.courses.skule.ca).
- The Faculty of Arts and Science lists resources including a past exam library [here](http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/exams/).

## Academic Advisor

Each year and discipline is assigned to an Academic Advisor within that department. Academic Advisors are individuals who know about the Faculty's various policies and resources, and can help with a broad range of issues from academic to personal to career-related. If you are having a personal academic related issue or question, your academic advisor is generally the first person you should go to.

**Find out who your Academic Advisor is, and what they can help you with [here](http://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/advising-support-services/academic-advising/)!**


**Steps to contact your academic advisor**
1. Go to https://portal.engineering.utoronto.ca/weblogin/sites/Student/#/home
2. Select the advising tab (see image below)
   
3. Select the “New Appointment” button to book an appointment with your advisor

## Tutoring Services

If you need a bit of extra help with a particular course or concept, take a look at the Skule™ tutor database at [tutors.skule.ca](http://tutors.skule.ca/). There you can search by course code to see a variety of tutors with pricing information, tutor backgrounds and qualifications, and contact information so that you can find someone who is a good fit for you. If you are or know a graduate student interested in tutoring others, you can also apply to be a tutor.

The tutors listed on this site include the courses that they know well, so it's easy to find very specific help. You can also often find past TAs and UofT Engineering students who know your course content very well. **Protip:** Some tutors offer group sessions, where multiple students can get help at the same time, and the cost per session is reduced. Ask tutors if they offer this option, and buddy up with a peer for extra help for less money! 

## P.A.S.S.
P.A.S.S. (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) - These study sessions are hosted by ~2 upper year students per course. They are organized and facilitated by the First Year Office, and they are run throughout the term for many first year courses. You can find out more, including the schedule for upcoming sessions [here](https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/advising-support-services/first-year-office/first-year-updates-deadlines/peer-assisted-study-sessions-pass/). The students who run these sessions are usually current undergraduate students, so not only can they help with course material, but they can often provide tips and insight to help you perform better overall. Plus, many other first year students attend these sessions, so there is an opportunity to work with others and learn from your peers.


## Study Spaces
- Organize your own study sessions with classmates! All you need is a space to work: 
    - Book a study room at one of UofT's many libraries [here](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/group-study-rooms)!
    - Use the Engineering and Computer Science Library on the 2nd floor of the Sandford Fleming building. The upper level of the library has open desks often used for group-work.
    - Use a common room or discipline-specific study room if you have one available.

## Ressources Offered by Professors

- Office Hours - I'm sure you've heard this many times, but that's because it works. Office hours give you the opportunity to sit down one-on-one (or bring a friend for a group session) and sort out all sources of misunderstanding. **Protip:**: many TAs are also willing to have office hours, or schedule meetings with you (or you and a friend) to review course material. If you learn well from a specific TA, approach or e-mail them and they will surely find a time to sit down with you.
- Additionally, as a University of Toronto student you have access to tutorials and office hours for many of your courses. Check the syllabi and course descriptions of your courses to find more details about these services in the current term.

## Other Academic Resources Offered by EngSoc 
- [F!rosh Anticalendar](http://www.http://courses.skule.ca/docs/Anticalendar_2016.pdf) - found on courses.skule.ca. A resource that gives a description, tips and important skills for all first year courses.
