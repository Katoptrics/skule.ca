If you are having difficulty with your courses or want to provide feedback, there are multiple levels of elected and appointed positions which can help address your concerns. Your class representative is usually a good place to start, but you can find the contact information for all Engineering Society positions [here](/about/engsoc) or below.
            
## Class Representatives
            
Class representatives are your first point of contact for course feedback, and are elected by your class at the beginning of the year. They gather feedback from students and present it to professors and other faculty members. They also have a vote at Faculty Council, where they contribute to discussions about widespread student issues.
            
## Discipline Club Chairs
            
Discipline Club Chairs manage each discipline club, which provide each discipline with representation, services, and activities. They are a fourth year student who is elected by your entire discipline to address the needs of the discipline as a whole. They regularly sit down with the Chair of your department to discuss proposed curriculum changes, laboratory renovations, student services, and issues that students are struggling with.
            
## VP Academic and the Academic Advocacy Committee
            
The VP Academic and the Academic Advocacy Committee (AAC) are elected student positions that address issues facing members of all disciplines. The committee is composed of the VP Academic, 3 Engineering Society board of directors members, undergraduate student representatives that sit on Faculty Council Standing Committees, and academic directors from each discipline club. They discuss matters ranging from the mid-course feedback project, developing the f!rosh anticalendar, creating advocacy strategies based on discussion points at Faculty Council Standing Committee meetings, and developing action plans to resolve student issues that have escalated through the above hierarchy.
            
 In 2016-2017, the Academic Advocacy Committee put together a recommendation report for the Engineering Career Centre to aid in their restructuring. [The full report can be found here](/academics/files/final-engineering-career-centre-reccomenation-report.pdf).
            
## Faculty Council
            
Faculty Council is the highest level of governance in the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. They influence how courses are taught and evaluated and what resources are available to students.
