<p>Exams and midterms from previous terms can be a helpful study aid, and there are several repositories of them available to undergraduate students.</p>
<ul>
    <li>[courses.skule.ca](http://courses.skule.ca/) is a repository for past examinations and course descriptions maintained by engineering students for core engineering courses and popular electives. It includes a decade of course material, and if you have something to contribute you can upload it to help thousands of students like yourself.</li>
