## One of my courses has a mandatory or ancillary fee, what does this mean and what can I do about it?

### Background Information
Each year, the University of Toronto Governing Council approves ancillary fees for certain courses, making them mandatory for the completion of a course or program. Non-approved fees can still be made optional to student (ie. an online resource that costs $10 to access), however if the fee is not approved, the student has other options (read steps below).

### Ancillary Fees
Ancillary fees are defined as fees mandatory to successfully complete a course or program. They include:
- Field trip costs
- Personal equipment that becomes the possession of a student (such as a lab coat or dissection kit)
- Administrative fees such as transcript fees or library fines

### Resources
- [Read more about Ancillary fees here](http://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/publicationsandpolicies/guidelines/ancillary-fees.htm#Report%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Ancillary%20Fees).

- Find this Year's approved fees: [Publication of Approved Ancillary Fees](http://www.planningandbudget.utoronto.ca/tuition/Ancillary_Fees.htm)

### What can you do when your course has a fee?

- Check the Ancillary Fees approved for the current academic year that you're in, found here [2017-2018 Approved Ancillary Fees](http://www.planningandbudget.utoronto.ca/Assets/Academic+Operations+Digital+Assets/Planning+$!26+Budget/lyanne/Category+5+Ancillary+Fees+2017-18.pdf). Look for your course-code and which specific fees were approved.
- If the fee was approved in the document, this fee is mandatory and must be paid for successful completion. You can always approach your class reps, or the professor directly, if you would like to raise concerns; however, the fees are legal.
- If you do not find your course or fee in the Approved Ancillary Fees for this academic year, it was not approved. If you would like to verify, or ask any questions, you may email [planning.budget@utoronto.ca](mailto:planning.budget@utoronto.ca).
- Since there is a course fee that is not mandatory, the professor must be able to provide a free alternative that will allow you to complete the course/degree. For example: if an online problem set costs $10 to access, but the fee is not mandatory, the professor may offer to accept paper submissions of a different set of problems.
- Talk to your class reps, or e-mail VP Academic ([vpacademic@skule.ca](mailto:vpacademic@skule.ca)) if you need additional support or have further questions.

## How do petitions work?

By the University of Toronto Engineering Faculty definition, a petition is: "your formal request for an exception to a Faculty or University rule, regulation or deadline." This means that you can petition midterms/exams/assignments/labs if there is an extenuating circumstance that prevents you from being able to attend/complete them.

For information on **reasons to file a petition**, and the **3 types of petitions (term work, final exam, special consideration)**, visit the [UofT Engineering Undergrad Petitions webpage](http://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/petitions/). Ensure to click on the link for each type of petition. You will need to know the petition deadlines and required documentations for each specific type of petition. These sections will also outline how soon you can expect a decision on your petition after submitting (your Academic Advisor can also provide more information).

## Academic Appeals

Academic appeals can be filed if the outcome of a petition is not satisfactory, and the student wants the decision to be reevaluated by a different body. An appeal also often contains information that was not provided during the initial petition (such as supporting medical or professional documentation). The appeal must be made within 30 days of the petition's decision. 

All information pertaining to the process of submitting an Appeal can be found [here](http://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/petitions/appeals/) and in the [Policy on Academic Appeals](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppdec122005.pdf). Ensure that you know your deadline, required documentation and way of submission. Once again, your Academic Advisor can help with details pertaining to Academic Appeals.
