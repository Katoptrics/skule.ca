<p>If you are an EngSoc-affiliated Club, Associated Entity, Project Directorship, or Discipline Club, and affiliated with Ulife/SOP, you can book projectors, speakers, and microphones through EngSoc. Instructions for booking non-EngSoc spaces can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-dLtknTFG0V99_lt0c71CH72E35bExgs/view" target=_blank>in this document</a>, and more information about SOP affiliation can be found <a href="https://sop.utoronto.ca/" target=_blank>in this site</a>.</p>
<p>EngSoc-affiliated organizations will be granted free use of projectors in classrooms, including speakers, microphones, projectors, etc. <b><i>However, clubs must pay for the services through campus events in advance and then get a reimbursement through EngSoc by filling out a cheque requisition and providing proof of purchase (such as a paid invoice). For further info on reimbursements, visit <a href=https://skule.ca/cheque_requisitions>skule.ca/cheque_requisitions</a>.</i></b></p>
