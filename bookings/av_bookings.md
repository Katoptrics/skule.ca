If you are an EngSoc-affiliated Club, Associated Entity, Project Directorship, or Discipline Club, and affiliated with Ulife/SOP, you can book projectors, speakers, and microphones through EngSoc. Instructions for booking non-EngSoc spaces can be found [in this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-dLtknTFG0V99_lt0c71CH72E35bExgs/view), and more information about SOP affiliation can be found [in this site](https://sop.utoronto.ca/).

EngSoc-affiliated organizations will be granted free use of projectors in classrooms, including speakers, microphones, projectors, etc. **However, clubs must pay for the services through campus events in advance and then get a reimbursement through EngSoc by filling out a cheque requisition and providing proof of purchase (such as a paid invoice).** [See here for further info on reimbursements](https://skule.ca/cheque_requisitions).

This project is intended to be used solely for the purpose of club or design team work, and not for personal projects or use. If you require a large number of rooms, a booking for a conference or other large event, and events that span over multiple days, please contact Rhonda at [rhonda@skule.ca](mailto:rhonda@skule.ca) and the VP Student Life at [vpstudentlife@skule.ca](mailto:vpstudentlife@skule.ca) to negotiate in-classroom AV usage.

For last-minute emergency AV equipment booking, projectors are also available for booking through the EngSoc office. Please contact Rhonda [rhonda@skule.ca](mailto:rhonda@skule.ca) or the VP Communications [vpcomm@skule.ca](mailto:vpcomm@skule.ca) for further inquiries. 

##General Rules:
- Equipment must be returned by 10:00AM on the business day following your equipment booking.
- Do not leave equipment on active for excessive periods of time (e.g. overnight).
- Do not perform maintenance on the projector under any circumstances.
- A $20 deposit is required for booking. If any rules are broken, or the equipment is not returned in the same condition that it was booked in, this deposit may not be returned. **Please note that there are only 2 projectors and one speaker.**
