<h1 class="title">Locker Rentals</h1>
<p>Please read the below instructions carefully if you are thinking of renting or are a current renter. For urgent requests regarding an existing locker rental please contact the VP Student Life at <a href="mailto:vpstudentlife@skule.ca" target=_blank>vpstudentlife@skule.ca</a>.</p>
<p>This year EngSoc will rent out lockers for students during the school year from September 1st, 2023 until May 31st, 2024. If you are interested in renting a locker, please visit lockers.skule.ca (you must supply your own lock). Please note that if you do decide to rent a locker, it is your responsibility to ensure all of your belongings are removed from the locker by May 31st. After that, locks are at risk of getting cut in preparation for the upcoming year. Please contact the VP Student Life if you have any concerns.</p>
<p>Lockers are available in Wallberg (Basement and 2nd Floor), Mechanical Building (Basement and 2nd Floor - near MC252/254), and Rosebrugh Basement. Additionally, lockers can be purchased through select Discipline Clubs and ASSU (Arts & Science Student Union, some conditions may apply). If you have any questions or concerns about this process or lockers in general, please don't hesitate to contact the Commuter director at <a href="mailto:commuter@skule.ca" target=_blank>commuter@skule.ca</a>.</p>
<p>EngSoc will not be liable or responsible for any stolen items from the lockers or items cleared from the lockers after May 31st. </p>
