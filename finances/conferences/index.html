<h1 class="title">Conference Funding</h1>
<p>It is in the interest of the Engineering Society that all undergraduate engineering students who wish to attend an academic conference or design competition to represent Skule, EngSoc and the University of Toronto to the engineering community have the opportunity to do so, without being restricted by financial needs. All undergraduate engineering students may thus apply for a subsidy from the Engineering Society to attend an academic conference or design competition that clearly demonstrates these points.</p>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>Expenses eligible for reimbursement include any travel, accommodation, and registration costs related to the conference/competition. Students may apply as individuals or as members of a club attending a conference or competition as a group. A club executive need apply only once on behalf of all attending members. Please keep in mind the following points:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Individuals can only be approved for conference funding once per fiscal year, whether as an individual or with a club</li>
    <li>This fund only applies to conferences that students/clubs attend, not direct or organize. Please apply for Affiliated Club Funding and Special Projects for student run initiatives.</li>
    <li>The Engineering Society reserves the right to compare your application against others as funding is limited.</li>
    <li>Students applying for conference funding must be Undergraduate Engineering Students at the University of Toronto.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Finances and Logistics</h3>
<p>While previous conference funding was limited, the Faculty of Applied Sciences and Engineering and associated Alumni Fund have generously donated $50,000 for the 2T3-2T4 schoolyear to sponsor students to use conference funding and attend conferences/events for their own personal development or community achievement. We thank the Faculty and alumnus for their support!</p>
<ol>
    <li>The maximum amount that may be received is up to $500 of the expenses or 50% of total costs per person of the expenses associated with the conference/competition (conference fees, travel expenses and hotel fees etc.), per individual, whichever is lesser.</li>
    <li>A maximum amount of $5000 may be allocated towards each conference/competition.</li>
    <li>The conference/competition costs must occur in the current fiscal year, that starts June 1 and ends May 31 of the next calendar year. If the expenses occur in the next fiscal year, you will need to submit an application after May 31.</li>
    <li>The funding pool is limited - it may be possible that the funding pool be exhausted before you apply. Applying early with cost estimates is encouraged.</li>
    <li>Please indicate the urgency of the funding in your email. This will help us prioritize applications. Appropriate reasons could include if the conference is coming up soon, or a deposit needs to be paid immediately etc.</li>
