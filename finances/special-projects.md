Students can apply for Special Projects funding from the Engineering Society for one-time purchases which benefit their organization or the Skule community as a whole. Purchases that are typically eligible for Special Projects Funding are:

- Hosting a non-annual conference
- New ideas that are not a part of the typical EngSoc budget (e.g. Skule Kup in its first year)

Some examples of past Special Projects are:
- A new Suds fridge
- Tools for the Blue and Gold Committee
- Instruments for the Skule Orchestra and the LGMB
- Hosting the 2012 Ontario Engineering Competitions at the University of Toronto
- A rocket test stand for University of Toronto Aerospace Team
