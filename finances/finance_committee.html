                          <p>Founded in 2008, following a call for increased accountability and help with a high volume of funding applications and allocations, the University of Toronto Engineering Society Finance Committee is a standing committee of the Engineering Society Board of Directors. As a standing committee, whose term lasts 1 year, members of the FC reserve no particular authority but are tasked with helping shape the Societyâ5™s financial future. Basically, they exist to provide the Board with funding recommendations and assist clubs who seek financial help or guidance.</p>
