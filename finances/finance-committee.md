Founded in 2008, following a call for increased accountability and help with a high volume of funding applications and allocations, the University of Toronto Engineering Society Finance Committee is a standing committee of the Engineering Society Board of Directors. As a standing committee, whose term lasts 1 year, members of the FC reserve no particular authority but are tasked with helping shape the Society's financial future. Basically, they exist to provide the Board with funding recommendations and assist clubs who seek financial help or guidance.

For the 2023-2024 year, it will be comprised of 2 Officers (VP Student Life and VP Finance), 4 members-at-large and 1 members of the Board of Directors. The following document provides a short introduction to the Engineering Society Finance Committee for those unfamiliar with their work.

## Finance Committee Internal Guidlines

Below are some general rules of prescripon of how much funding can be approved by the finance commiee for these common items.

Food for in person events:
- Case by case based on size of club/event
- Generally take $5 a person for food (except dinner dances)

Internal engagement such as exec team socials:

- Judges â†’ about $25 a speaker /industry partner
- REWARDS/GIFTS SHOULD BE PHYSICAL GIFTS/NOT GIFT CARDS

Alcohol:
- **Engsoc cannot purchase alcohol** , so we cannot approve any spending on this, as we do not hold a LCBO license (only Suds does).

Furniture and equipment:
- As long as furniture/equipment is demonstrang utility for the majority of the student body, it is appropriate to approve.

Stationary:
- Generally staonary such as paper, pens are not considered as justifiable expenses as that reserves budget away from other clubs/entities that is in need of funding.

Levies:
- Levy applicaon/renewal approval should be reserved for entities that have major expenditures, but don't generate enough revenues to cover it.
- Levies will not qualify for conference funding and special projects as levy applicaon should have accounted for such costs forecasted.

Miscellaneous expenses:
- Miscellaneous expenses that are not defined with an explanaon of what's specifically within the line item will not be approved, typically conngency would act as your miscellaneous expenses.

CPSIF:
- If the enty/club is projecting a massive surplus by the end of year, funding may not be appropriate to be approved.

How Finance Committee Meetings Will Be Conducted:
- If attending the Finance Committee Meetting, an applicant can present about 1 to 2 minutes giving an overview of their application and why the funding is needed.
- After the applicant's presentation, our committiee respectfully asks that discussion about the applicant's budget occurs without interruption by viewing members to determine a decision, at a cap of 8 minutes discussion. Only the applicant may speak during this period if an inquiry is needed.
- Once a decision/conclusion has been made, there will be a 3 minute period to discuss with viewing members about the decision and take questions about the proposed recommendation.
- Discussion may be shorter or longer depending on length of application and size of funding request

How to complete a budget:

On a high level, reasonable and complete applications during the summer months of a year can be comprised of quotes easily pulled from the internet, previous quotes with an inflation factor, or average/previous actual numbers.

Reasonable and complete applications during the fall/winter semesters can be easily pulled from the internet and hard quotes from suppliers/producers. Applications may also be submited as a tracker of total expenses/revenues up to date of application. [For more information watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9ToPRikZw8)
