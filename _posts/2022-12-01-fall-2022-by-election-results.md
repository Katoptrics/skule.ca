Hello all,<br> <br> I am pleased to announce the results of the November 2022 Fall By-Elections <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/123FhcWGXS3AxbOZohniGk3LnYBeu_GIp/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. I would like to thank everyone who participated and put time and effort into this process, and a big congratulations to all the winners.<br> <br> Notice - I would like to point out that we would be re-running the voting of the 2nd Year Mineral Representative position as a result of a technical error having prevented eligible voters from voting this period. The voting period will most likely be from 9am on Friday, December 1st, 2022 till 5pm on Saturday, December 2nd, 2022. I sincerely apologize to the candidate affected by the error and hope this ensures that the candidate has a fair election moving forward.
