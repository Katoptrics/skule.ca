Hey Everyone, apologies for the delay in posting this here. It was sent out to all members of the Society on the day nominations closed (Friday, February 24th, 2023) as the .skule.ca domain was down. <br> <br> The candidates list can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5E1z4hiZWgAoDDC-S4tQGhPGYvUi-Sq/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. The campaigning period for the election has ended and voting will be live between 9:00 am on Monday, March 6th, 2023 and 5:00 pm on Wednesday, March 8th, 2023. Make sure to exercise your right to vote at vote.skule.ca at that time. Other than that, hope everyone's having a great semester and have a great rest of your weekend.<br> <br> Cheers<br> Your CRO - Dhruv
