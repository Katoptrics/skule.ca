Hey everyone<br> <br> CRO Ruling 4 can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_oFxBzfBFdP0LYBFVUjUPRf1GSFR0RHP/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. The ruling concerns the infraction of section 8.0.1, 8.7.1, 8.7.2, 8.3.3, and 8.7.3 of Bylaw 3 as a result of a post by the candidate in question being posted outside the campaign period, including the Engineering Society logo on a hardhat, as well as answering questions in a public fashion. If you believe there is an error, please notify me, the CRO as soon as possible at cro@skule.ca.<br> <br> The decision may be appealed through the process outlined under section 10 of Bylaw 3.
