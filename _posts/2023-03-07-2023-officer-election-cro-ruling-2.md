The official CRO Ruling 2 for the Officer 2023 Election may be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zxxfQpxroa9ACUbmCU2R9luXFK83SQ66/view?usp=sharing">here</a><br> , and it concerns the disqualification of a candidate due to a violation of Bylaw 3, specifically sections 0.2.2 c), 2.3.2, and 8.5.4, which concern the candidate's campaign assistant asking questions at the All Candidates Forum while being a non-member of the Society. Specific details can be found in the ruling itself. If you feel this is a mistake, feel free to contact me, the CRO (Dhruv) at cro@g.skule.ca. As always, the decision may be appealed by the candidate as per Bylaw 3, section 10.
