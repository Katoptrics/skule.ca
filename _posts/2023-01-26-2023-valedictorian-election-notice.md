No signatures are required for the form, so it should only take a couple minutes to fill out at most!<br> <br> The position is elected in a vote, with all fourth years in engineering as eligible voters. The primary responsibility is to prepare and deliver a speech at the annual Gradball.<br> <br> IMPORTANT NOTE - The election campaign rules for this election and all future elections may be undergoing a major change subject to Board approval in the EngSoc Board of Directors meeting on Tuesday, January 31st, 2023. I will inform all candidates if the rules are changed and request that you please go through Bylaw 3 thoroughly before the All Candidates Meeting to ensure a smooth campaign process.<br> <br> Other than that, hope y'all are having a great semester and have a great rest of your week.
