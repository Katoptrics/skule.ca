Hi Everyone,<br> <br> I hope you have all been enjoying your summer so far! The June 2023 election cycle is approaching and there are a couple of Project Director positions still open. If you are interested in applying for any of the open positions for the 2T3-2T4 SkuleTM year please read the <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMfrCxTH-49oq2bee5MEME-pbBb0YidY/view?usp=sharing>election notice</a>. <br> <br> Nominations will open on Monday June 5th 9 am EDT and close Friday June 9th 5 pm EDT and will be accepted through the nomination form <a href=https://forms.gle/RdYYkbuqSmLUAdjV8>here</a>. <br> <br> Please note that Project Directors and Internal Temporary Directors are not elected by the student body but go through an interview process and are elected by the Board of Directors at the end of June. As such there will be no campaigning during these elections.<br> <br> Feel free to reach out to me via email at cro@g.skule.ca if you have any questions or concerns.<br> <br> Cheers,<br> Katherine Jia<br> CRO 2T3-2T4
