                  <p>If you are an EngSoc-affiliated Club, Associated Entity, Project Directorship, or Discipline Club, and affiliated with Ulife/SOP, you can book projectors, speakers, and microphones through EngSoc. Instructions for booking non-EngSoc spaces can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-dLtknTFG0V99_lt0c71CH72E35bExgs/view" target=_blank>in this document</a>, and more information about SOP affiliation can be found <a href="https://sop.utoronto.ca/" target=_blank>in this site</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  There is currently a pilot project in place as of Fall 2022 that may continue into Winter 2023. EngSoc-affiliated organizations will be granted free use of projectors in classrooms, including speakers, microphones, projectors, etc. This project is intended to be used solely for the purpose of club or design team work, and not for personal projects or use. If you require a large number of rooms, a booking for a conference or other large event, and events that span over multiple days, please contact Rhonda at rhonda@skule.ca and the VP Student Life at <a href="mailto:vpstudentlife@skule.ca">vpstudentlife@skule.ca</a> to negotiate in-class room AV usage. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  For last-minute emergency AV equipment booking, projectors are also available for booking through the EngSoc office. Please contact Rhonda <a href="mailto:rhonda@skule.ca">rhonda@skule.ca</a> or the VP Communications <a href="mailto:vpcomm@skule.ca">vpcomm@skule.ca</a> for further inquiries.
